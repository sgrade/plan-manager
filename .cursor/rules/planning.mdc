Code changes are allowed in the follwoing cases:
1. Aligned with the plan documented via plan-manager MCP server
2. Deviations are discussed, reflected in the plan, and approved
3. Explicit user request to perform a task outside plan-manager

Development workflow:
- Before each task: write execution_intent (objective, scope, acceptance), request approval
- After each task: write execution_summary (what changed, where), request review, record changelog entry
- Default context: current plan → current story → current task
- Use context tools to select/advance (no parallel execution)
