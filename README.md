# Plan Manager

Sync AI agent(s) and models around common goals and constraints.

## Overview

AI agents supported by models operate in a limited context window. If the amount of work is greater, there is a need to periodically coordinate the agent with broader plans. Moreover, if several AI models or agents perform different tasks, for example, to optimize costs, they need to be synchronized. The Plan Manager makes it easier to coordinate agents and LLMs with a plan according to user-defined constraints.

## Positioning

For large projects we use project management systems like Jira or Linear. With their help, leaders coordinate work of developers. 

Plan Manager is a tool for a single developer or orchestrator to coordinate work of one or more AI agents or models. For example, ask an expensive thinking model to create a plan and document it in Plan Manager. Delegate work items (stories, tasks) to less expensive models. Review the summary of work before and after the work item is completed, correct deviations from the plan. Export the report to the changelog and/or to larger project management systems.

## Core concepts

- Plan: groups stories.
- Story: user-facing goal; contains tasks.
- Task: discrete unit of agent work.
- Statuses: apply to plans, stories, and tasks; primary progression is TODO → IN_PROGRESS → PENDING_REVIEW → DONE; side states: BLOCKED, DEFERRED.
- Approvals: optional guardrail before progressing status.
- Dependencies: tasks/stories may block others.
- Priority: 0–5 (0 is highest).

## Usage

### Convenience

Plan manager is stable and has proven to be very useful for coordinating the actions of AI agents and models working on the same project. On the other hand, it may lack the user-friendly interface, flexibility, and other qualities that are expected from a mature product aimed at a wide audience. This is a reasonable decision: to develop quickly with limited resources; to focus on functions that arise as a result of practical use in real projects, and to avoid the overhead of non-core development. 

Currently, the most convenient way is to run Plan Manager in devcontainer on the same laptop/desktop computer where you have IDE/agents. Use web interface of [MCP Inspector](dev/mcp-inspector/README.md) as the main GUI and the browse files function to view the raw data generated by Plan Manager. 

### Connecting to the Server

- **Start the server:** `uv run pm`
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- **Browse files:** `http://localhost:3000/browse`

Note: change `localhost` to `host.docker.internal` if accessing from another container on the same host.

### Docs

The workflow diagrams are in [docs/project_workflow.md](docs/project_workflow.md)

There is a document primarily for agents using Plan Manager, which can also be useful for humans to understand how the agents learn about Plan Manager:
- [usage_guide_agents.md](docs/usage_guide_agents.md) - exposed as an MCP [resource](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/resources).

### Hints

Use `/` in the client (Cursor) chat window to list Plan Manager prompts (instructions, templates to interact with the server).

Use MCP inspector to explore Plan Manager capabilities - [doc](dev/mcp-inspector/README.md).
